          <h3 class="h3">Introduction</h3>
          <p>The ANOPISS platform is unprecedented. It has come with a new generation of games. The ANOPISS platform is
            the first collection of Role-Playing Games (RPG). Surprisingly, this Platform is based on Crypto gaming and
            Non-fungible token (NFT). The ANOPISS has come into existence to reshuffle the meaning of game playing. With
            the ANOPISS, playing is no longer traditional and a waste of time, playing games has become as realistic as
            the games of ancient civilizations like the Greek Olympics to mention a few. In ancient times, winning a
            game was either to gain freedom, to spare one’s life, or to identify one’s self with the best. However, in
            this new age of meta-verse and digital pursuits, games must be associated with money gaining and investment.
          </p>
          <p>More interestingly, the ANOPISS will make now it possible for game lovers to select a game amongst dozensof
            games in the ANOPISS collection. The ANOPISS games will allow players to engage in face-to-face playing with
            their matches. The winners, undoubtedly, will earn crypto. As you can see, it is no longer playing for the
            sake of playing. The ANOPISS has made it possible for players to play and earn crypto. The earned crypto is
            not fake. The earnings are real and usable.</p>
          <p>Another revolutionary change the ANOPISS has come with is the ability of players to withdraw their crypto
            earnings to external wallets. There is of course an ANOPISS wallet in which earnings can be deposited and
            withdrawn. However, players can, in multiple ways, deposit and withdraw from and into external crypto
            wallets. Unlike many platforms in which players’ earnings are stuck in the internal wallet, the ANOPISS
            makes it authentically possible for players to manage their earnings the way they want because they are
            theirs, not ours! What is more, this is not inextricably limited to crypto, it is extended to NFTs and
            ANOPISS tokens that are manageable in different ways: the players can sell them, withdraw them to external
            wallets and exchange them. With our ANOPISS Tokens, you can trade, farm, and also do staking!</p>
          <p>What makes the ANOPISS games enjoyable is the availability of 2D visuality. Also, the ANOPISS games provide
            state-of-art interactive effects with simple colors, high visual quality, and smooth motion, all made
            possible by artificial intelligence (AI) to better control the actions in the game. The ANOPISS will start
            with a table game. However, with time, we will include other RPG and PVP games.To say the least, the ANOPISS
            Platform will connect millions of players from all over the world. The ANOPISS cares about the ecological
            system. The ANOPISS is the change the world has been expecting. Play and earn with the ANOPISS.</p>

          <h3 class="h3">Plot</h3>
          <p>Who has not spoken or read about ancient civilizations? Without question, everyone does. Why do we dig into
            the ancient
            civilizations? Is that for entertainment or to spend off time? The status quo is thriving due to the hard
            work of the
            ancient civilizations: our ancestors. To not undermine any great ancient civilizations, the Mesopotamian
            civilizations,
            the Greek civilization and the Egyptian civilization are directly responsible for the enormous achievements
            that
            humanity have so far reached. The ancienty of the Egyptian civilization is a temporal and special ancienty
            not a
            civilizational one. The Egyptian civilization, specifically the Pharaohic Civilization, proved to have
            reached an
            advanced level of development. The most apparent evident is the long-lasting Giza Pyramids. They are the
            most puzzling
            argument that the Pharaohic civilization was very advanced at all levels.</p>
          <p>The Pharaohic wall graphics tell us a lot about this immortal civilization. Anyone, even someone who is not
            interested
            in the Pharaohic civilization, must
            have, at certain point, been exposed to the jackal: a man with the head of a jackal. This creature is called
            the Anubis.
            Who is the Anubis? The Anubis was
            an ancient Egyptian god of death. Anubis was associated with funerary cult and care of the dead. He was the
            “Conductor
            of Souls”. He is credited for the
            invention of embalming, an art he first employed on the corpse of Osiris. After glorious battles, the Anubis
            wanted to
            reward his warriors. Therefore,
            he created tournaments for them to have fun and gain rewards.</p>
          <p>The ANOPISS is a neologized version of Anubis. It has come to reward people for all what they have done for
            this era.
            With the ANOPISS, you are caught
            in-between a story of the past, a blooming present and a glowing future. With the new generation of games,
            the ANOPISS
            provides, you can play and earn
            effortlessly. The 21st Century ANOPISS has come to leave its mark on this era. It has come from nowhere to
            care about
            you, only you. Thanks to the ANOPISS,
            who have the intention to make it possible for players to earn though playing, and make the earnings real.
            Players can
            materially get their winnings. Away
            from scamming, the ANOPISS gives you logical warranty for whatever you do in this regard. Be the ANOPISS’
            loyal warriors
            and the
            ANOPISS will reward you.

          <p>The project simply aims at creating a profitable environment where players are in front of dozens of
            options. Players
            can learn, play, earn, invest, exchange
            ANOPISS-related and ANOPISS-supported items. What is more interesting, gamers retain full ownership of their
            in-game
            items in contrast to the current
            centralized systems (i.e., chess, dame, 8pool, etc.) where players have their ingame items lost when banned
            or when
            platforms shut down</p>
          <p>The ANOPISS platform will include a limitless amount of games. Players, now, have the possibility to
            suggest a game to
            be included on the platform and
            our team will take this suggestion into consideration. There is also the developer-mode which enables the
            possibility to
            develop your own game based
            on our platform conditions and terms. The games included on the platform are mainly role-playing games in
            which the
            euphoria of playing truly manifests.
            The face-to-face challenges make it more enjoyable. The first game that our platform will launch will be 8
            Pool.
            Alongside the enjoyability of this game,
            the ANOPISS’s job is to add to the enjoyability of games the earn ability. Being able to earn provides
            players with a
            feeling of realism and satisfaction.
            To reach the peak of enjoyment, the ANOPISS platform will arrange championships and the winners will gain
            big prize. The
            first launched game, will
            be a beta-version in which players will test the reliability of the platform.</p>
          <p>Supporting the ANOPISS COIN will make you earn. Playing ANOPISS games will make you earn. Investing in the
            ANOPISS COIN
            makes you earn. The reward
            is in the ANOPISS COIN. More importantly, The ANOPISS also has a nonrefundable utility token which will be
            used as the
            medium of exchange between
            participants in the Ecosystem-based ANOPISS Games. The ANOPISS is up-todate and supports the meta-world’s
            novelties.

          <p>The Anubis was believed to be a God on earth and had the most power. He was responsible for making laws and
            keeping
            order, ensuring that Egypt was not
            attacked or invaded by enemies and for keeping the Gods happy so that the Nile flooded and there was a good

                official documents had to have his seal of approval. He was also responsible for the supply of food,
